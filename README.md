ANTI-DRONE AIR DEFENCE SYStEM
ANTI-DRONE AIR DEFENCE SYSTEMS
Drone defence systems are required since they can be used to assault fortified sites. It is vital to deploy anti-drone systems in sensitive locations for detecting, localizing, and defending against the invading drones in order to reduce these risks. The drone detection system includes radar system and EO/IR system. Radar specifications and features are perfectly suited for the detection of low altitude, slow flying, and small signature targets. The EO/IR system is a long-range, high-performance camera.

Data Understanding
Analysis approach
Deploying an anti-drone technology in a geofencing-free but security-sensitive location is therefore crucial. Drone detection and localization may be possible using a variety of technologies, including radar surveillance, audio surveillance, video surveillance, and radio frequency (RF) monitoring. This system detects the drone and provides the Elevation data of the drone. 
Data cleaning
Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset. When combining multiple data sources, there are many opportunities for data to be duplicated or mislabeled. If data is incorrect, outcomes and algorithms are unreliable, even though they may look correct. There is no one absolute way to prescribe the exact steps in the data cleaning process because the processes will vary from dataset to dataset.
Data Analysis
The systematic application of statistical and logical techniques to describe the data scope, modularize the data structure, condense the data representation, illustrate via images, tables, and graphs, and evaluate statistical inclinations, probability data, and derive meaningful conclusions known as Data Analysis
